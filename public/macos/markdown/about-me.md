## Career

Infinity Works

Sky
Automation Tester
Company Name Sky
Dates Employed May 2016 – Jun 2018
Employment Duration 2 yrs 2 mos
Location Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom

At Sky, I took on a two-fold remit. To provide insight and best practices regarding automation testing tools, techniques and processes to increase the confidence in releasing our legacy apps, which either had very little or inconsistent levels of automation testing.

The second portion was to be a point of engineering contact for the next-generation applications produced by our Leeds developers. This involved championing ideas around test data generation, stubbing of applications to separate concerns, re-usability of test suite helpers to remove the pain of common functions required but often difficult to automate, and the introduction of containers for applications under test, in order to allow easily replicatable environments on local machines and CI.

Over the past year, I have implemented a micro service testing framework to cover a greenfield transformation project. This involved using wire mock alongside docker to produce mock services, which are used to agree Consumer driven contracts between service producer & consumers. Mocks were then built to allow autonomous development between squads, and avoid blockers in delivery. Tests were written against the mock services, which would be run against the developed service, with downstream/upstream services mocked out, to perform component integration testing, and early integration testing is run against each PR initiated via team city. A shell script would write the test results to each GitHub PR, along with slack notifications, providing all members of the squad, full and early visibility of test coverage and progress. This has proved to be efficient and invaluable, however some of the day-to-day constraints to exploratory test data, proved to be an issue in our test automation, namely around data provisioning. I anticipate most of the future work on this platform will be supporting the karate/wiremock/docker test infrastructure alongside looking at creating reproducible data-sets.
